# Blockchain-based Identity Verification Systems

Blockchain technology offers a secure and immutable platform for identity verification, reducing fraud and enhancing user privacy. By utilizing NanoScript on the Solana blockchain, developers can create decentralized identity verification systems that are both efficient and privacy-preserving. Below are example snippets demonstrating how NanoScript can be used for blockchain-based identity verification systems.

## Example 1: Registering a New Identity

```javascript
create_new_identity_record(userPublicKey, identityData)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Create a new identity record on the blockchain
PUSH <UserPublicKey>
PUSH <IdentityData>
ENCRYPT
WRITE_EXTERNAL_DATA # Store the encrypted identity data securely on the blockchain
```

This snippet shows how to create a new identity record, encrypting personal data before storing it on the blockchain to ensure privacy.

## Example 2: Verifying Identity for Access Control

```javascript
verify_user_identity_for_access(userPublicKey, accessRequestSignature, grantAccessLabel)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Verify a user's identity for access to a secure resource
PUSH <UserPublicKey>
PUSH <AccessRequestSignature>
VERIFY_SIG # Verify the signature to confirm the user's identity
JUMPIF <GrantAccessLabel>
# Logic for denying access
:GrantAccessLabel
# Logic for granting access to the secure resource
```

Here, a user's identity is verified through signature verification before granting access to a secure resource, showcasing the use of blockchain for secure access control.

## Example 3: Updating Identity Information

```javascript
update_existing_identity_information(userPublicKey, newIdentityData)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Update existing identity information on the blockchain
PUSH <UserPublicKey>
PUSH <NewIdentityData>
ENCRYPT
WRITE_EXTERNAL_DATA # Update the blockchain with the new encrypted identity data
```

This example illustrates how existing identity information can be updated, with changes securely encrypted and recorded on the blockchain, maintaining the integrity and privacy of user data.

These snippets provide a glimpse into how NanoScript can be applied to develop blockchain-based identity verification systems, offering secure, immutable, and private solutions for managing digital identities on the Solana blockchain.
