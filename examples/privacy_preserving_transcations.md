# Privacy-preserving Transactions

Privacy-preserving transactions ensure that users can engage in blockchain activities without exposing sensitive information. NanoScript's functionalities on the Solana blockchain support the development of transactions that protect user privacy through encryption, anonymity layers, and secure verification mechanisms. Below are example snippets demonstrating how NanoScript can be used for privacy-preserving transactions.

## Example 1: Encrypting Transaction Details

```javascript
encrypt_and_send_transaction_details(transactionData, receiverPublicKey)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Encrypt transaction details before sending
PUSH <TransactionData>
PUSH <ReceiverPublicKey>
ENCRYPT
NETWORK_REQUEST # Send the encrypted data to the network
```

This snippet shows how to encrypt transaction data, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to the intended recipient.

## Example 2: Anonymous Voting

```javascript
cast_vote_privacy_preserving(voteOption, voterAnonymityKey)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Cast a vote in a privacy-preserving manner
PUSH <VoteOption>
PUSH <VoterAnonymityKey>
ENCRYPT
CALL_CONTRACT # Submit the encrypted vote anonymously
```

Here, an example of anonymous voting is provided, where votes are encrypted with a key that preserves the voter's anonymity, enhancing privacy in voting applications.

## Example 3: Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC)

```javascript
perform_secure_multi_party_computation(computationRequest, party1Data, party2Data, ...additionalPartyData)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Perform a computation involving multiple parties without revealing inputs
PUSH <ComputationRequest>
PUSH <Party1Data>
ENCRYPT
PUSH <Party2Data>
ENCRYPT
... # Additional parties' data as needed
CALL_CONTRACT # Execute the secure multi-party computation
```

This snippet illustrates a secure multi-party computation, where encrypted inputs from multiple parties are combined to perform a computation without revealing any individual's data.

These examples highlight the potential of NanoScript in facilitating privacy-preserving transactions on the Solana blockchain, offering users enhanced security and confidentiality in their blockchain interactions.
