# Tokenized Real Estate Transactions

Tokenization of real estate on the blockchain enables fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and streamlined transactions, revolutionizing property investment and management. NanoScript on the Solana blockchain offers a robust framework for creating, managing, and trading tokenized real estate assets. Below are example snippets demonstrating how NanoScript can facilitate tokenized real estate transactions.

## Example 1: Creating a Real Estate Token

```javascript
issue_new_property_token(propertyDetails, totalTokens)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Issue a new token representing fractional ownership in a property
PUSH <PropertyDetails>
PUSH <TotalTokens>
CALL_CONTRACT # Create the token and distribute shares to investors
```

This snippet illustrates the process of issuing a new token that represents fractional ownership in a property, allowing for the democratization of real estate investment.

## Example 2: Buying and Selling Property Tokens

```javascript
execute_property_token_transaction(tokenAmount, buyerAddress, sellerAddress)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Execute a transaction to buy property tokens
PUSH <TokenAmount>
PUSH <BuyerAddress>
PUSH <SellerAddress>
ORDER_EXECUTE # Facilitate the transfer of tokens from seller to buyer
```

Here, a transaction for buying and selling tokenized real estate shares is executed, showcasing how blockchain technology can simplify and secure property transactions.

## Example 3: Automated Rent Distribution

```javascript
distribute_rental_income_to_token_holders(tokenHolderCount, distributedIncomeAmount, tokenHolderAddress)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Distribute rental income to token holders automatically
FOR <TokenHolderCount>
    READ_EXTERNAL_DATA <TokenHolderAddress>
    PUSH <DistributedIncomeAmount>
    NETWORK_REQUEST # Send rental income to each token holder proportionally
NEXT
```

This example demonstrates the automated distribution of rental income to token holders, ensuring fair and transparent income sharing based on token ownership.

These snippets provide insights into how NanoScript can be leveraged for tokenizing real estate assets, enabling more accessible, efficient, and transparent transactions within the real estate market on the Solana blockchain.
