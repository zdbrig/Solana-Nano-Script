# Automated DeFi Strategies with NanoScript

NanoScript enables the development of complex, automated DeFi strategies on the Solana blockchain with high efficiency and low transaction costs. Here are example snippets showcasing how NanoScript can be used to automate liquidity management, yield farming, and order execution in decentralized finance.

## Example 1: Automated Liquidity Provision

```javascript
liquidity_add(poolAddress, tokena_amount,tokenb_amount)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Add liquidity to a Solana-based DEX pool
PUSH <PoolAddress>
PUSH <TokenA_Amount>
PUSH <TokenB_Amount>
LIQUIDITY_ADD
```

This snippet automates the process of adding liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX) pool, enhancing liquidity provider (LP) strategies.

## Example 2: Yield Farming Automation

```javascript
harvest_and_reinvest(yieldFarmingContract, swapContract, rewardsToken, lpTokenAmount)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Harvest yield from a farming protocol and reinvest
CALL <YieldFarmingContract>
PUSH <RewardsToken>
CALL <SwapContract> # Swap rewards for more LP tokens
PUSH <LP_TokenAmount>
LIQUIDITY_ADD # Reinvest into the pool
```

This example demonstrates how NanoScript can automate the yield farming process, from harvesting rewards to reinvesting them for compound interest.

## Example 3: Dynamic Order Execution

```javascript
execute_order_based_on_price_feed(priceFeedAddress, targetPrice, orderDetails, executeTradeLabel)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Execute an order based on external price feed
READ_EXTERNAL_DATA <PriceFeedAddress>
PUSH <TargetPrice>
GT
JUMPIF <ExecuteTradeLabel>
PUSH <OrderDetails>
ORDER_EXECUTE

:ExecuteTradeLabel
# Additional logic for trade execution
```

NanoScript can dynamically execute orders based on external data, such as price feeds, allowing for sophisticated trading strategies that react to market conditions in real-time.

These snippets illustrate the power and flexibility of NanoScript in automating DeFi strategies, offering developers and traders on the Solana blockchain tools to create efficient, responsive financial applications.
