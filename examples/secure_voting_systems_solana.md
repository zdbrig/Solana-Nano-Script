# Secure Voting Systems on Solana

Implementing secure and transparent voting systems is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchain platforms like Solana. NanoScript facilitates the creation of voting mechanisms that are both secure against tampering and verifiable. Below are example snippets showcasing how NanoScript can be utilized to build a secure voting system.

## Example 1: Casting a Secure Vote

```javascript
encrypt_and_cast_vote(voterPrivateKey, voteOption, votingContractAddress)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Encrypt and cast a vote
PUSH <VoterPrivateKey>
PUSH <VoteOption>
ENCRYPT
PUSH <VotingContractAddress>
CALL_CONTRACT # Submit the encrypted vote
```

This snippet demonstrates how a voter can securely cast their vote using encryption, ensuring that the vote remains confidential until the voting period ends.

## Example 2: Tallying Votes

```javascript
decrypt_votes_and_tally_results(adminPrivateKey, totalVotes, encryptedVotes, tallyFunctionAddress)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Decrypt votes and tally the results
PUSH <AdminPrivateKey>
FOR <TotalVotes> # Iterate over all votes
    PUSH <EncryptedVote>
    DECRYPT
    PUSH <TallyFunctionAddress>
    CALL_CONTRACT # Tally the decrypted vote
NEXT
```

After the voting period concludes, an administrator or automated process can decrypt and tally the votes, maintaining the integrity of the voting process.

## Example 3: Verifying Vote Integrity

```javascript
verify_vote_hash(voteHash, publicVoteRecordHash, hashMatchLabel)
```

After compiling :

```nano
# Verify the hash of the vote matches the public record
PUSH <VoteHash>
PUSH <PublicVoteRecordHash>
VERIFY_HASH
JUMPIF <HashMatchLabel>
# Handle the case where hashes do not match
:HashMatchLabel
# Proceed with vote counting
```

Ensuring the integrity of each vote is crucial. This snippet shows how to verify that the hash of a decrypted vote matches the hash recorded at the time of voting, ensuring the vote has not been altered.

These examples highlight how NanoScript can be used to create a secure and transparent voting system on the Solana blockchain, leveraging encryption for confidentiality, and hash verification for integrity.
