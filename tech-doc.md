# Technical Document: NanoScript Virtual Machine for Solana

## Executive Summary

NanoScript introduces a compact, efficient scripting solution designed for the Solana blockchain, aiming to enhance smart contract development for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Inspired by JavaScript's simplicity and powered by a C-language interpreter's performance, it brings trading-specific functionality, ensuring efficient and straightforward blockchain logic implementation.

## Introduction

The Solana blockchain's capabilities for developing decentralized applications are unparalleled, offering speed and scalability. However, the complexity of smart contract development and computational limitations necessitate innovative solutions like NanoScript. This document outlines a new virtual machine (VM) within the Solana Virtual Machine, specifically designed for NanoScript execution, focusing on DeFi applications.

## Architecture Overview

### Design Philosophy

The new VM is based on efficiency, security, and developer accessibility principles, providing a powerful yet user-friendly environment for DeFi application development.

### Components

- **C Programming Language Interpreter (in Rust)**: The core of NanoScript's execution, offering fast and reliable script interpretation.
- **Source Account**: Stores NanoScript bytecode, containing logic and operations.
- **Stack Account**: Manages execution flow and temporary data, akin to a CPU stack.
- **Data Account**: Acts as the main memory, storing script execution data.
- **Execution Program**: A custom Solana smart contract that executes NanoScript, managing fuel consumption and script interactions.

### Interactions

The VM's operation involves script loading, environment initialization, script execution, and state management, concluding with blockchain state updates.
