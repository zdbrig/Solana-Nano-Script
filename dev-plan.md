## Overview

This document outlines a structured 6-month development plan for the NanoScript project on the Solana blockchain, with milestones set every two months. The plan is designed to guide the project from its initial foundation and design phase through development, testing, and eventual deployment.

## Month 1-2: Foundation and Design

### Objective
Lay the groundwork for NanoScript and define the architecture.

### Tasks
- Conduct a thorough review of Solana's documentation and existing smart contract limitations.
- Design the NanoScript language syntax, inspired by JavaScript for accessibility.
- Define the architecture for the custom Solana program, including the execution model and Fuel mechanism.
- Draft a detailed specification document for NanoScript.

### Milestone 1
Complete the NanoScript design document, including language syntax and virtual machine specifications.

## Month 3-4: Development and Testing

### Objective
Begin coding the interpreter and basic functionality of NanoScript.

### Tasks
- Start development of the NanoScript interpreter in C.
- Implement the Fuel mechanism within the interpreter.
- Develop and test the Source, Stack, and Data Account structures.
- Integrate the first set of trading primitives into NanoScript.

### Milestone 2
Successfully execute basic NanoScript programs on a local Solana testnet.

## Month 5-6: Advanced Features and Deployment

### Objective
Implement advanced features, complete thorough testing, and prepare for deployment.

### Tasks
- Enhance NanoScript with additional trading primitives.
- Conduct extensive testing with complex trading strategies.
- Prepare comprehensive documentation for developers.
- Deploy the NanoScript interpreter to the Solana mainnet.

### Milestone 3
Launch NanoScript on the Solana mainnet, complete with developer documentation.

## Post-Development

### Objective
Monitor, iterate, and expand the ecosystem.

### Tasks
- Monitor the performance and stability of NanoScript on the mainnet.
- Collect feedback from early adopters and refine the language and execution environment.
- Foster a community of NanoScript developers through forums, social media, and hackathons.

This development plan provides a clear roadmap for the NanoScript project, outlining the steps needed to achieve a successful launch and foster a vibrant developer community.
